\usage{
marginalMeans(
  form,
  f_dat,
  a_dat,
  dimn,
  keep_term_order = FALSE,
  residualmean = FALSE,
  whichterm = NULL,
  no_icpt = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{form}{formula of the model}

\item{f_dat}{data.frame of factors}

\item{a_dat}{matrix which contains the dependent variables. It must have as
many rows as f_dat. Usually a_dat is the result of calling
\code{\link{array2mat}} on the orginal data array.}

\item{dimn}{the original dimension names for the array corresponding to the
column names of \code{a_dat}}

\item{keep_term_order}{logival variable whether to keep the order of the
model terms as provided in form (TRUE) or all interaction terms should follow
all main effect terms (FALSE, default)}

\item{residualmean}{logical variable; if TRUE, each factor term is extracted
from the data after computing the given marginal mean (default: FALSE)}

\item{whichterm}{character, numeric or logical vector; indices of model terms
which should be analyzed (default: NULL, meaning all terms are included)}

\item{no_icpt}{logical value; if TRUE, global mean is subtracted before
computing the marginal means (default: FALSE)}
}
\value{
A named list containing the marginal means for each model term
