\arguments{
\item{.arraydat}{a numeric array with named dimnames containing the EEG (or
other) data. Missing values are not allowed.}

\item{factordef}{a named list of factor definitions, containing the following
elements:
\itemize{
\item{"between"}{"character vector of between-subject factors (default: NULL)"}
\item{"within"}{"character vector of within-subject factors (default: NULL)"}
\item{"w_id"}{"name of the dimension which identifies the subjects
(default: "id")}
}}

\item{peakdef}{a named list of peak definitions. A peak definition is a
three-element integer vector which specifies the time window (start and
end point) and the polarity (1 for positivity and -1 for negativity).}

\item{bwdat}{a data.frame which contains the identification codes
(factordef$w_id) and the group memberships (factordef$between) of the
subjects. Missing values are not allowed.}

\item{verbose}{logical value indicating whether means for each factor level
should be also returned}

\item{avg_around_peak}{integer value which specifies the number of data points
which are considered +- in the "mean around the peak" measure}

\item{nperm}{integer value giving the number of permutations (default: 999L)}

\item{useparallel}{logical value; if TRUE (default), computations are done
in parallel}

\item{ncores}{integer value corresponding to the number of cores;
if NULL (default), it is set to the maximum number of cores available}

\item{par_method}{parallelization method; can be "snow" (default) or "mc"
(multicore)}

\item{cl}{a cluster definition for snow-type parallelization; if NULL
(default), it is set up automatically}

\item{iaterms_last}{logival variable whether all interaction terms should
follow all main effect terms (default: TRUE)}

\item{seed}{an integer value which specifies a seed (default: NULL)}
}
\value{
A list object.
}
\description{
\code{peakAnova} performs automatic peak detection and runs traditional
ANOVA on them

OLD VERSION, DO NOT USE IT! updates will follow...

\note{
The function computes type I p-values - this is correct if the design
is fully balanced and orthogonal (if the number of between-subject
factors is one, it may have slightly unequal group sizes).
